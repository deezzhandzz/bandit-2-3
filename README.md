# bandit-2-3
For this one you need to login as bandit2 now this is a little tricky because the file name is spaces in this file name.  So the file name has spaces to fix this youll put it out there like this "spaces/in/this/file/name".  and that fills up the spaces so the cat doesn't freak out. So what you should have down is "cat spaces/in/this/file/name" and then you should have the password for 3
